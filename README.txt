## Installation

To install PolyMod and its dependencies, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/polymod.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd polymod

# Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use env\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

PolyMod can be used to process multimodal inputs and generate text responses. Follow the instructions below to use the project:

```bash
# Example usage command or code snippet
python run.py --input input_data.txt --output output_data.txt
```

## Model Architecture

PolyMod employs a mixture of experts architecture, integrating text, image, and audio modalities. The model architecture includes transformer-based encoders for text, convolutional neural networks for images, and recurrent neural networks for audio processing. Combined representations are used to generate text outputs.

## Training

PolyMod can be trained on multimodal datasets using the provided training script. Adjust hyperparameters, such as batch size and number of epochs, according to your specific requirements.

```bash
# Example training command or code snippet
python train.py --data train_data.txt --epochs 10 --batch_size 32
```

## Inference

To perform inference with the trained PolyMod model, use the inference script. Provide the path to the trained model weights and input data to generate text predictions.

```bash
# Example inference command or code snippet
python predict.py --model model_weights.h5 --input test_data.txt --output predictions.txt
```

## Examples

Explore examples demonstrating the capabilities of PolyMod in real-world scenarios. Sample input data, expected outputs, and explanations are provided to showcase the model's effectiveness.
